...Linear Search in the arrays...
In this program we are going to do linear search in the arrays,As we know that:
Linear search is also called as sequential search algorithm. It is the simplest 
searching algorithm. In Linear search, we simply traverse the list completely 
and match each element of the list with the item whose location is to be found. 
If the match is found, then the location of the item is returned; otherwise, the 
algorithm returns NULL.
It is widely used to search an element from the unordered list, i.e., the list 
in which items are not sorted. The worst-case time complexity of linear search is O(n).
We can done this as we define a function as linearSearch() in which linera search operation
is done.
we can done this with the for and if-else loops.
