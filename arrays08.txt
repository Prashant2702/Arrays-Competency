...Printing all the subarrays in an array...
In this program we are going to print out the subarrays of the array
using the for loops.
A subarray is a contiguous part of array. An array that is inside another array.
For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], There are 10 non-empty sub-arrays.
The subarrays are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4).
In general, for an array/string of size n, there are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty subarrays/substrings.
