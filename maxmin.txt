...Printing the maximum and the minimum element in an array...
In this program we are going to find out the maximum and the minimum elmemnt in an array.
Here we have to intialize the  values of both as if we does not do that then the compiler
gives them an garbage value.
Here we use an built in function named as for manNo and minNo.
For this we used an new header file named as climits.with the help of for loops we
can easily done this program.
