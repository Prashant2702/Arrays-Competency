...Longest Arithematic Subarray...
An arithmetic array is an array that contains at least two integers and the
differences between consecutive integers are equal. For example, [9, 10], [3, 3, 3],
and [9, 7, 5, 3] are arithmetic arrays, while [1, 3, 3, 7], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 4] are
not arithmetic arrays.
This Question is one of the tricky question which was asked in Google Kickstart
contest.

Steps
1. While iterating in the array we need to maintain the following variables,
a. Previous common difference (pd) - To compare it with current
common difference (a[i] - a[i-1]).
b. Current arithmetic subarray length (curr) - It denotes the arithmetic
subarray length including a[i].
c. Maximum arithmetic subarray length (ans) - It denotes the max.
Arithmetic subarray length till a[i].
2. While iterating, there will be two cases,
a. pd = a[i] - a[i-1]
i. Increase curr by 1
ii. ans = max(ans, curr)

3. After loop ends, output the answer. (stored in ans variable).
