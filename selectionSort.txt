...Selection Sort in the Arrays...
In this program we are going to print out the selection sort in the arrays.As we know that:
The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

The subarray which already sorted. 
The remaining subarray was unsorted.
In every iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the beginning of unsorted subarray. 

After every iteration sorted subarray size increase by one and unsorted subarray size decrease by one.
we can simply done this using the for and if else loops.
