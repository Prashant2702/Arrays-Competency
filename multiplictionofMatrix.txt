Challenge 2 - Matrix Multiplication
Problem
Given two 2-Dimensional arrays of sizes n1Xn2 and n2Xn3. Your task is to
multiply these matrices and output the multiplied matrix.
Constraints
1 <= n1,n2,n3 <= 1,000

Sample test case
Input

3X4 4X3

Output

Approach
1. Make a nested loop of order 3. In the outer loop iterate over rows of
the first matrix and in the inner loop iterate over columns of the
second matrix.
2. Multiply rows of the first matrix with columns of the second matrix
