...Printing the maximum sum of the subarrays...
In this program we are ging to print out the maximum sum of the sub array using the for loop.
A subarray is a contiguous part of array. An array that is inside another array. 
For example, consider the array [1, 2, 3, 4], There are 10 non-empty sub-arrays. The subarrays 
are (1), (2), (3), (4), (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (1,2,3), (2,3,4) and (1,2,3,4). In general, for
 an array/string of size n, there are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty subarrays/substrings.
